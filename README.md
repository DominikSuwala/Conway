"# Conway" 

This project implements Conway's Game of Life in Python. The world is of a fixed size. Cells in successive generations are determined by living neighbor (adjacent and diagonal cells) count. A living cell needs exactly 2 or 3 neighbors in order to survive to the next generation, while a dead cell can come to life if exactly 3 neighbors are alive.

## Requirements

Python 2.7.*

## Usage

> python conway.py <input_file.txt>
